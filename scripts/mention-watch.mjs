/**
 * Finds threads where someone is already asking the question CPT answers, and queues them for a
 * human to reply to.
 *
 * This is the honest version of "comment everywhere". It reads public search APIs, matches against
 * a fixed set of queries, and writes what it found into marketing/queue/. It does not post, it
 * does not hold credentials, and it has no code path that writes to anyone else's site — see
 * marketing/community-playbook.md for the rules the human then follows.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/mention-watch.mjs                # last 7 days, all sources
 *   node scripts/mention-watch.mjs --days 2
 *   node scripts/mention-watch.mjs --source hn    # hn | reddit
 *   node scripts/mention-watch.mjs --all          # include threads already seen
 *
 * State: marketing/.mention-seen.json — thread ids already queued, so a daily run only ever shows
 * you what is new. Delete it to start over.
 *
 * Environment:
 *   REDDIT_CLIENT_ID, REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET
 *     Optional but effectively required for the Reddit half. Reddit now answers "403 Blocked" to
 *     anonymous www.reddit.com/*.json from most addresses, and the supported way through is their
 *     API rather than a workaround: create a free "script" app at
 *     https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps, and export the id and secret. Without them the Reddit
 *     searches are skipped and HN still works.

 * it would take to read it.
 *

 * without this turns "wezterm windows" into every thread on HN containing the word "windows". A hit
 * is kept only if its title or body contains at least one term from every group in `must`, so the
