/**
 * Tells the checkout whether a payment has finished landing.
 *
 * Crypto payments confirm out of band: the buyer pays in the NOWPayments widget, the IPN reaches
 * `/api/payment-webhook` some seconds or minutes later, and only then is the licence dated. The
 * checkout polls this so it can say "done" when it is actually done. The old flow had a button the
 * buyer pressed themselves, which reported success to people who had paid nothing and to people
 * whose provisioning had not run yet.
 *
 * `notBefore` is what makes this work for renewals. A renewing subscriber *already* holds a
 * licence, so "do they have one" would answer yes before their payment was honoured and show a
 * success screen for a period they had not been given. The checkout passes back the expiry the
 * invoice was created for, and the answer is yes only once the licence actually reaches it.
 * Granting is the last step of `provisionPurchase`, so that date is exactly the "fully provisioned,
 * email sent" marker.
