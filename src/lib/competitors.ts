/**
 * The comparison pages' source of truth: one entry per terminal CPT gets compared against.
 *
 * ## The rule for this file
 *
 * Every claim about somebody else's product is checked against *their* documentation before it
 * is written here, and `sources` records where it was checked. These pages are read by people who
 * already use the competitor — a wrong claim about WezTerm on our own domain is the thing that
 * gets screenshotted, and it costs more than the page earns.
 *
 * `verifiedOn` is the date the facts below were last read off those sources. Re-run
 * `scripts/vs-refresh.mjs` when it goes stale; it diffs the live docs against this file and
 * reports what moved rather than editing anything itself.
 *
 * `wins` is not a courtesy. Each entry names where the competitor genuinely beats CPT, in its own
 * terms. A page that only flatters CPT converts worse than one a skeptic can trust, and half of
 * these terminals are free and excellent.
